## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

- Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/anpato/exspresso-cli/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/anpato/exspresso-cli/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

- **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- **If your contribution is major,** such as a new feature, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
